# ðŸ’¤ LazyVim

My WINDOWS OS template for configuring [LazyVim](https://github.com/LazyVim/LazyVim) 
mainly used with Powershell.
After removing the initial .git folder (from cloning the LazyVim/starter repo) 
this is now the git repo I wil push all my LazyVim WINDOWS OS config adjustments 
to keep track off and share it via my GH/gwd666/myLazyVim.git@xps13Win ie the 
repos branch is: xps13WIN.

Refer to the [documentation](https://lazyvim.github.io/installation) to get started.
