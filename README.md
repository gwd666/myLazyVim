# ðŸ’¤ LazyVim

My xps13 Windows template for [LazyVim](https://github.com/LazyVim/LazyVim).
After removing the initial .git folder (from cloning the LazyVim/starter repo) this is now the git repo I wil push all my LazyVim WINDOWS OS config adjustments to keep track off and share via my GH/gwd666 repo Branch: xps13WIN.

Refer to the [documentation](https://lazyvim.github.io/installation) to get started.
