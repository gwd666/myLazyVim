# ðŸ’¤ LazyVim

My xps13 kali-linux WSL2 template for [LazyVim](https://github.com/LazyVim/LazyVim).
After removing the initial .git folder (from cloning the LazyVim/starter repo) this is now 
the git repo I wil push all my LazyVim config adjustments to in oerder to keep 
track of and share via it my GH/gwd666/myLazyVim.git@kali-lazyvim 
ie the 'kali-lazyvim' branch of the repo.

Refer to the [documentation](https://lazyvim.github.io/installation) to read more.
