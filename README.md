# ðŸ’¤ LazyVim

This represents the `main` (or default) branch and follows my Ubuntu 20.04 WSL2 on my PCs setup for 
[LazyVim](https://github.com/LazyVim/LazyVim).

After removing the initial .git folder (from cloning the LazyVim/starter repo) this is now 
the git repo I wil push all my Ubuntu distro LazyVim config adjustments to in 
order tp keep track of and share it via my GH/gwd666/myLazyVim repo.

Refer to the [documentation](https://lazyvim.github.io/installation) to read more.
